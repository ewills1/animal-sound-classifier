# Audio Classification System (In Progress)

This project aims to develop an **Audio Classification System** using **Convolutional Neural Networks (CNNs)**, **Python**, and **PyTorch**. The system will classify audio data into predefined categories by learning patterns in audio features. The project is currently under development and is designed to explore the capabilities of deep learning for audio analysis.

---

## Features (Planned)

- **Audio Preprocessing**: Transform raw audio into spectrograms or other feature representations.
- **Convolutional Neural Network (CNN)**: Utilize CNN architectures to extract features and classify audio data.
- **PyTorch Framework**: Leverage PyTorch for building, training, and evaluating the model.
- **Real-Time Classification**: Implement real-time audio classification for practical use cases (future goal).

---

## Technologies Used

- **Python**: For data processing, modeling, and evaluation.
- **PyTorch**: For deep learning model development and training.
- **Librosa**: For audio feature extraction and preprocessing (planned).
- **Matplotlib/Seaborn**: For visualizing audio data and model performance.

## Setup and Usage

1. Clone the repository:
   ```bash
   git clone <repository_url>
   cd audio-classification-system
   ```

2. Install required packages:
   ```bash
   pip install -r requirements.txt
   ```

3. Preprocess audio files:
   - Add raw audio data to the `data/raw` directory.
   - Run the preprocessing script (to be implemented).

4. Train the model:
   ```bash
   python train.py
   ```

5. Evaluate the model:
   ```bash
   python evaluate.py
   ```

## Planned Features

- **Advanced CNN Architectures**: Explore ResNet or other state-of-the-art models.
- **Feature Extraction**: Integrate MFCCs, mel-spectrograms, and chroma features.
- **Dataset Expansion**: Add more diverse audio datasets for robust classification.
- **Web Interface**: Build a simple front-end for uploading and classifying audio files.
